Optimization of Sample Reception Workflows
Project Overview

This project aims to enhance the efficiency of laboratories during the reception and processing of samples. By leveraging data analysis and machine learning, we identify patterns, predict operational workload, and optimize staff allocation to reduce bottlenecks during peak hours.
Key Features

    Predictive modeling using Random Forest and Gradient Boosting to forecast workload.

    Identification of critical patterns, such as peak hours and high-demand days (e.g., Wednesdays at 12:00 PM and 9:00 PM).

    Simulations to test resource allocation strategies and their impact on efficiency.

Problem Statement

Laboratories often struggle with:

    High workloads during peak hours.

    Inefficient staff allocation.

    Lack of data-driven decision-making. These issues directly impact service quality, research productivity, and patient care.

Objectives

    Identify patterns in sample reception to improve operational workflows.

    Predict workload during critical hours using machine learning.

    Provide actionable strategies to optimize resource management.

Methodology

    Data Generation: Creation of a realistic dataset simulating sample reception, including variables like time, day, and staff availability.

    Exploratory Analysis: Identification of trends, such as peak workload hours.

    Predictive Modeling: Models used:

        Random Forest: Achieved MAE of 1.39.

        Gradient Boosting: Achieved MAE of 0.03.

    Simulations: Tested resource allocation strategies to reduce workload.

Results

    Increasing staff availability during peak hours significantly reduced workload.

    Identified the key variables influencing efficiency:

        Staff availability.

        Interaction between sample volume and staff capacity.

Proposed Solutions

    Increase staff during peak hours.

    Implement a machine learning-based system to predict and balance workloads.

    Prioritize urgent sample types during high-demand periods.
